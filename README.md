# HangfireOrchestratorPOC
Hangfire Orchestrator application is a POC - prove of concept - to Collabra Orchestrator, with two projects:
	 
- **Console Application with HangFire server**
- **API Application with client only**

==================================================================

 TYPES OF JOBS - background jobs using Hangfire: 
 
           fire-and-forget(to offload the method invocation), 
           delayed(to perform the call after some time)
           and recurring(to perform methods hourly, daily and so on).

HANGFIRE SERVER  - localhost:5001/hangfire

	IMPORTANT - Server should be always on to perform scheduling and processing logic
           Hangfire Server consist of different components that are doing different work:
           workers listen to queue and process jobs,
           recurring scheduler enqueues recurring jobs,
           schedule poller enqueues delayed jobs,
           expire manager removes obsolete jobs and
           keeps the storage as clean as possible, etc.

JOBS STATES 
      
           Enqueued,
           Scheduled,
           Awaiting,
           Processing,
           Failed, - expira 24hrs(ou method WithJobExpirationTimeout)
           Succeedede Deleted


ENQUEUE method does not call the target method immediately, it runs the following steps instead:

	  Serialize a method information and all its arguments.
           Create a new background job based on the serialized information.
           Save background job to a persistent storage.
           Enqueue background job to its queue.
      After run SERVER BackgroundJob.
           Enqueue method immediately returns to a caller.Another Hangfire component,
           called Hangfire Server, checks the persistent storage for enqueued background jobs
           and performs them in a reliable way.

SERVER ENQUEUED jobs are handled by a dedicated pool of worker threads

          Fetch next job and hide it from other workers.
          Perform the job and all its extension filters.
          Remove the job from the queue.


SCHEDULE  

          send an email to newly registered users a day after their registration
          BackgroundJob.Schedule(TimeSpan.FromDays(1))
          HF Server periodically checks the schedule to enqueue scheduled

RECURRENT TASKS - JOBS

          RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate("easyjob", () => Console.Write("Easy!"), Cron.Daily);
          overloads to run jobs on a 
              minute, 
              hourly, 
              daily, 
              weekly, 
              monthly

ARGUMENTS

          use JSON to serialize some adicional information


TOKENS - cancellation tokens

          background jobs that have a cancellation token parameter in a method 
          and polls the storage to watch their current states


EXCEPTIONS

          AutomaticRetryAttribute class - if failed job to be automatically retried after increasing delay.


 HANGFIRE PRO 
 
          is a set of extension packages that boost the performance and simplify
          the maintenance of background job processing in large applications
